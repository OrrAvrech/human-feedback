A pose $p$ in our work is defined by a tuple of $(\dot{r}_a, \dot{r}_x, \dot{r}_z, r_y, \mathbf{j}_p, \mathbf{j}_v, \mathbf{j}_r, c_f)$, where $\dot{r}_a \in \mathbb{R}$ is the root angular velocity along the Y-axis; $(\dot{r}_x, \dot{r}_z \in \mathbb{R})$ are root linear velocities on the XZ-plane; $r_y \in \mathbb{R}$ is the root height; $\mathbf{j}_p \in \mathbb{R}^{3j}$, $\mathbf{j}_v \in \mathbb{R}^{3j}$, and $\mathbf{j}_r \in \mathbb{R}^{6j}$ are the local joint positions, velocities, and rotations in root space, with $j$ denoting the number of joints; $c_f \in \mathbb{R}^4$ is a binary feature obtained by thresholding the heel and toe joint velocities to emphasize the foot ground contacts. In particular, the 6D continuous rotation representation is adopted.
